            The Porsche 928 is a stunning car made from 1977 - 1995. With a V8 engine, this masterpiece hit top speeds of 140 - 165 mph depending on the year and model you had. For years, before 1983, the car was fitted with either a 3-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. After 1983 when they gave an updated reboot to the car you were able to now choose between the 5-speed manual transmission and a new 4-speed automatic transmission.

            When released to the public in 1978 the car was equipped with 219 horsepower, by the end of the era in 1995 they were up to 345 horsepower, which was great for the time and even beat out the company's newest 1995 Porsche 911 Turbo, which had had a twin-turbo engine. Finally coming to the end of the era for the Porsche 928, the last cars produced in 1995 were the Porsche 928 GTS series.
