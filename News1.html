The Audi R8 is one of the most favored cars by the Audi community and is sadly being discontinued this year (2024). First announced in 2006 this car has had multiple versions including the Coupé, Spyder, GT, and the very rare Audi R8 e-tron. After its 17-year run, the company has decided to stop production to meet its goals to become an all-electric company.

Although technically not being discontinued this year the F8 does deserve to be on the favorite list. The Ferarri F8 Is the great successor to the 488 and has had a short production time spanning only 4 years (2019-2023). Two main medals were made of the F8 including the Tributo and Spider. The spider had a folding hard top that would be amazing for sunny drives. This car will not have a direct successor itself.
