        <p>The Pontiac GTO is a beautiful classic made between the years of 1963 and 1974. The model in the photo above was made in 1968, the beginning of the second generation of the Pontiac GTO. This two-door convertible is built with rear-wheel drive, a 6.6L V8 engine, and has 350 horsepower available for the consumer. 
            <br>
            The second generation offered both a 3-speed and 4-speed manual transmission while also offering a 3-speed automatic transmission. The original Pontiac GTO was ended in 1974 with a revitalization of the GTO in 2004 with a completely new look. The new version of the GTO was soon ended in 2006 and after that, in 2010 GM decided to completely discontinue Pontiac itself.
