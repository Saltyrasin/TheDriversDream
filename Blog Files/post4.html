        <p>Hey everyone! I recently discovered the coolest Nike store and I just had to share my experience with you all. The store is located in Oregon and as soon as I walked in, I was blown away by the design and layout of the store. The walls were adorned with neon lights and the merchandise was displayed in a way that made it easy to browse through.glad to have captured a picture of it. It was a reminder of the beauty and excitement that can be found in the unexpected moments of life.
          After browsing through the store, I snapped a picture of myself outside of the store to remember the experience. The store is definitely one of the coolest Nike stores I've been to and I highly recommend checking it out if you're in the area.
